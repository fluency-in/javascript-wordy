# JavaScript: Wordy

Write a program that takes a word problem and returns the answer as an integer.

## Step 1

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

The program should handle large numbers and negative numbers.

Remember, that these are verbal word problems, not treated as you
normally would treat a written problem.  This means that you calculate
as you move forward each step.  In other words, you should ignore order
of operations.  3 + 2 * 3 = 15, not 9.

Use the tests to drive your solution by deleting the `skip` in one test
at a time.

## Step 2

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

## Step 3

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

> What is 7 minus 5 minus 1?

> What is 9 minus 3 plus 5?

> What is 3 plus 5 minus 8?

## Step 4

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 times 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

> What is 78 plus 5 minus 3?

> What is 18 times 3 plus 16?

> What is 4 times 3 divided by 6?

> What is 4 plus 3 times 2?

## Extensions

Implement questions of the type:

> What is 2 raised to the 5th power?

Remember to write failing tests for this code.

These tests use jasmine-node, which is a testing framework written for Node.js.

You will need:

* Node.js
* The Node Package Manager (NPM)
* jasmine-node

You can install both Node.js and NPM with a download from nodejs.org: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Use NPM to install jasmine-node:

    npm install jasmine-node -g

To work on an exercise, change to the directory of the exercise:

    cd hello-world

This contains the files for the exercise.

    .
    ├── README.md
    └── hello-world.spec.js

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `jasmine-node` command:

    jasmine-node hello-world.spec.js
